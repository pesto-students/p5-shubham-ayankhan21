### Week 3 Javascript assignment

## Excercise 1 
#  Creating a memoize function from scratch for a reducer function and checking the time of running these functions

## Excercise 2
##  Explaining the 3 helper functions
# All the 3 functions deal in manipulating the "this" keyword 
# They help us set or pass our desired arguments to a generic function
# .bind() - this function creates a copy of the function using the arguments we supply
# .call() - this function doesnt create a copy of the function but rather directly calls the function using the arguements we pass
# .apply() - similar to the call function but instead of passing arguements one by one we send an array of arguments

## Excercise 3
# Checking the output of the following code and understanding why it is giving the output.

## Excercise 4
## Using the concept of closure we enable encapsulation of object properties
# A stack function which does the basic operations of the stacks and an object property items which needs to be hidden from the user.
